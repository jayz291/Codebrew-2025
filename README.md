# FlashLingua Description
FlashyLingua is a multi-language flashcard app built with Python and Tkinter. The app allows users to select a language, flip flashcards to reveal translations, and track their progress with regular review sessions. After every twenty words, a feedback screen provides users with a summary of their known and unknown words. Additionally, the app includes sound effects for interactions such as flipping a card, marking a word as known or unknown and finishing a session, creating a more immersive learning experience.
