# FlashLingua Description
FlashyLingua is a multi-language flashcard app built with Python and Tkinter. The app allows users to select a language, flip flashcards to reveal translations, and track their progress with regular review sessions. After every twenty words, a feedback screen provides users with a summary of their known and unknown words. The program tracks your progress! If all words in a csv file have been learnt (that is, ticked off using the 'tick' button), users will encounter a 'Congratulations!' screen with a special SFX.
